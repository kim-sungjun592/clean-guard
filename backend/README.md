# Backend — PHP REST API

PHP 8 + MySQLi, one file per endpoint, no framework. Every endpoint
includes `config.php` for its database connection, sets CORS headers so
the React frontend (served from a different origin) can call it, and
returns JSON.

## Setup

1. Copy `config.local.example.php` to `config.local.php` in this folder
   and fill in your real database host/name/user/password.
   `config.local.php` is git-ignored and never committed.
   - Alternatively, set the `DB_HOST` / `DB_NAME` / `DB_USER` /
     `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables on your server — `config.php`
     falls back to those if `config.local.php` doesn't exist.
2. Create the tables described in [`../database/README.md`](../database/README.md).
3. Point your PHP host (or the frontend's `VITE_API_URL`, see
   [`../frontend/.env.example`](../frontend/.env.example)) at wherever
   this `backend/` folder is served from.

## Endpoints

| File | Method | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `upload.php` | POST | Ingests one ESP8266 reading; inserts into `sensor_data` / `sensor_data_test`. |
| `getSensors.php` | GET | Latest reading per device (`?table=live\|test`) — powers Live/Test mode. |
| `getHistory.php` | GET | One device's readings (`?device_id=`), grouped into 5-minute buckets — powers the trend chart. |
| `getSensorLog.php` | GET | Every reading, newest first, paginated (`?page=&pageSize=`) — powers History mode's log. |
| `getDevices.php` | GET | Full device registry. |
| `addDevice.php` | POST | Adds a device (validates required fields + unique ID). |
| `updateDevice.php` | POST | Updates a device's name/location/status (ID is read-only). |
| `deleteDevice.php` | POST | Removes a device. |
| `getAIStatus.php` | GET | Reads a device's latest (or timestamp-matched) AI prediction from `restroom_sencor_fake_data`. Read-only; currently not called by the frontend (the AI panel is a placeholder — see the frontend's `AIStatusCard.jsx`). |

Write endpoints use prepared statements with bound parameters, with one
noted exception: `upload.php` uses raw string-interpolated SQL and
accepts a `"table": "history"` option that maps to a table
(`sensor_data_history`) that doesn't exist in the schema — both are
pre-existing characteristics of that endpoint, left unmodified since this
cleanup pass does not change functionality.
